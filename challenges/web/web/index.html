      </p>
      <p class="description">
        This page seems to allow you to see the account information of a user if you have their ID. I wonder if we can get the info of the admin user?

        We need to defuse this timebomb! But the problem is, the secret code is split into 5 pieces across 5 different URLS! And the pieces change every 10 seconds! You need to write a script that will get all 5 pieces of the code, piece them together, and submit
        them to /timebomb/submit via POST request! (The final code should be sent in the "key" part of your POST request data. Dont send it in the URL, send it in the body.)
